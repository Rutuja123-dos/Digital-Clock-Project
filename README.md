## Digital-Clock-Project

## 🕒 Interactive Digital Clock & Calendar

A Python-based GUI application that provides a real-time display of the current time and date. This project explores graphical user interface (GUI) development, event loops, and recursive function timing to create a functional desktop utility.

## 🚀 Features
* Real-Time Synchronization: Uses the time module to fetch and display the system time with second-level precision.

* Dynamic UI Updates: Implements recursive refreshing using the .after() method to update the display every 1000ms without lag.

* Aesthetic Styling: Features a custom "Dark Mode" interface with high-contrast colors (Purple on Black) for better readability.

* Comprehensive Display: Shows the time (HH:MM:SS), AM/PM status, and the full date (DD/MM/YYYY) simultaneously.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Language: Python 3.13

* Libraries: Tkinter (Standard GUI Library)

* Modules: time (Standard Library)

## 📂 Project Structure
* digital_clock.py: The main script containing the GUI layout and the recursive time-update logic.

* README.md: Documentation of the project.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.

2. Clone this repository or download the script.

3. Run the script in your terminal: python digital_clock.py

The clock window will pop up on your desktop immediately.
